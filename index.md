### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    I enjoyed this lab because in part one I learned how to create multiple functions with different purposes. In part two I learned how to use static cast on doubles and ints to change from doubles to ints and ints to doubles. I learned a lot from this lab and the things that I learned were helpful in the labs that came after.

* Lab 6

    I enjoyed this lab because I learned how to use command line arguments in my code and I learned how to make a basic game of blackjack using command line arguments. I learned how to check the amount of command line arguments used, and use command line arguments to read the inputs and assign them to values. Learning about command line arguments being used in code was really useful for me to know in the labs that followed.

* Lab 10

    I enjoyed this lab because I learned how to read values from a file, and I learned about a simplified method to check for prime numbers. I also learned how to use 2d vectors and check if a command line argument was in one part of the 2d vector and then found the location with the other part of the 2d vector. These things were important for me to learn because it allowed me to understand code that seemed complicated but once I understood it I was able to understand and complete the lab.
